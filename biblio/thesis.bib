The structure of LoRa signals makes their decoding performance extremely sensitive to synchronization errors. To alleviate this constraint, we propose a modification of the LoRa physical layer, which we refer to as differential CSS (DCSS), associated with an original synchronization algorithm. Based on this modification, we are able to demodulate the received signals without performing a complete frequency synchronization and by tolerating some timing synchronization errors. Hence, our receiver can handle ultra narrow band LoRa-like signals since it has no limitation on the maximum carrier frequency offset, as is actually the case in the deployed LoRa receivers. In addition, in the presence of the Doppler shift varying along the packet duration, DCSS shows better performance than CSS, which makes our proposed receiver a good candidate for communication with a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite.},

This survey presents a perspective on existing NoC research. We define the following abstractions: system, network adapter, network, and link to explain and structure the fundamental concepts. First, research relating to the actual network design is reviewed. Then system level design and modeling are discussed. We also evaluate performance analysis techniques.

The main advantage of our approach is that decoding does not rely on dedicated preamble symbols, which usually introduce considerable overhead in terms of energy consumption and utilization of the wireless channel. We show that omitting the preamble can be achieved by buffering the signal in the receiver and processing the samples twice; first to synchronize and in a second iteration to decode the actual data. To introduce our approach, we provide a theoretical description, including a discussion of the implications of synchronizing on data symbols instead of optimized preamble sequences. The practical feasibility of the algorithm is shown by simulations and experiments using prototype implementations based on software defined radio. We implemented our algorithm for two technologies, a custom ultra low-power BPSK transceiver and the O-QPSK physical layer of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Finally, we present an extension of the algorithm that allows us to reduce the buffered data to a small constant number of samples, making our algorithm applicable to physical layers independent from their maximum frame size.},

A particular form of \$M\$-ary orthogonal modulation designed for DSSS systems, the CCSK modulation, has been proposed for this purpose. This modulation inherently allows noncoherent processing at receiver side and has the potential to improve the energy efficiency of the data link with respect to classical DSSS/BPSK signals. In this article, \$q\$-ary (\$qın \textbackslash lbrace 2,M\textbackslash rbrace\$) LDPC-based channel coding for \$M\$-ary CCSK is analyzed, both in terms of robustness and computational complexity. \$(q=M)\$-ary LDPC-coded CCSK is compared to a bit-interleaved binary LDPC-coded CCSK strategy. Though both solutions provide very reliable links for practical decoding algorithms, it is shown that adequately-designed bit-interleaved binary LDPC-coded CCSK signals can offer the additional flexibility inherent to BICM while remaining competitive from the point of view of both error rate performance and computational complexity. The latter can be adjusted through the use of incomplete iterative demapping schedules. The optimization of this performance/complexity trade-off is discussed.},

We show that a fractionally-spaced whitened matched filter, matched to the known data pulse, provides a set of sufficient statistics when a tapped delay line channel model is assumed, and that the problem is ill-posed when the channel impulse response is generalized to a CT, finite-length model. Practical approximations are considered that circumvent this ill-posed condition. Recursive computation of the joint-ML metric is developed. Together, the FE processing and metric recursion provide a receiver structure which may be interpreted as the theoretical foundation for the previously introduced technique of per-survivor processing, and they lead directly to generalizations. Several FE processors representative of those suggested in the literature are developed and related to the practically optimal FE.},

Measurements are obtained by synchronising the locally generated signal in the receiver with the signals received. A synchronisation procedure called acquisition adjusts the code phases of the incoming signal and the locally generated pseudo-random replica sequence of the corresponding satellite to a small timing offset and finds the residual frequency modulation after carrier wipe-off. New fast techniques for acquiring signals indoors in conditions that require a significant number of computations are presented. In this work many arithmetic operations are shared when exploring different search options by using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and a technique based on the frequency domain replica shifting. It is shown that FFT can be used for the joint processing of multiple (code-phase/frequency) search options in both dimensions at once. With a slight degradation in performance, the algorithm has a modified version that implements the technique using two-dimensional FFT. Several possible processing schemes are presented. Moreover, the presented shifting replica approach in the frequency domain can significantly reduce computational complexity by jointly acquiring different satellites.},

In 1977, the International Standards Organization (ISO) initiated work on Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) to address these requirements. This paper briefly describes the OSI Reference Model. The OSI Reference Model is the highest level of abstraction in the OSI scheme. The paper first describes the basic building blocks used to construct the network model. Then the particular seven-layer model used by OSI is briefly described, followed by a discussion of outstanding issues and future extensions for the model.},

Other new high-throughput and low-latency video applications including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and online gaming, are also proliferating. Due to the related stringent requirements, supporting these applications over wireless local area network (WLAN) is far beyond the capabilities of the new WLAN standard - IEEE 802.11ax. To meet these emerging demands, the IEEE 802.11 will release a new amendment standard IEEE 802.11be - Extremely High Throughput (EHT), also known as Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi) 7. This article provides the comprehensive survey on the key medium access control (MAC) layer techniques and physical layer (PHY) techniques being discussed in the EHT task group, including the channelization and tone plan, multiple resource units (multi-RU) support, 4096 quadrature amplitude modulation (4096-QAM), preamble designs, multiple link operations (e.g., multi-link aggregation and channel access), multiple input multiple output (MIMO) enhancement, multiple access point (multi-AP) coordination (e.g., multi-AP joint transmission), enhanced link adaptation and retransmission protocols (e.g., hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)). This survey covers both the critical technologies being discussed in EHT standard and the related latest progresses from worldwide research. Besides, the potential developments beyond EHT are discussed to provide some possible future research directions for WLAN.},

This makes them an attractive platform for the development of cognitive radios that can adapt to changes in channel conditions, traffic load, and user requirements. However, to realize this goal, we need a software framework that supports both MAC protocol and PHY layer development in an integrated fashion. In this paper we report on our experience in using two different software frameworks for integrated PHY-MAC development for SDRs: GNU Radio, which was originally designed to support PHY layer development, and Click, a framework for protocol development. We also discuss a number of broader system considerations, such as what functionality should be offloaded to the SDR device.},

The protection of integrity and confidentiality of information and the protection from unauthorized access are important issues. However, due to factors such as resource limitations, absence of centralized access points, open wireless medium and small size of the sensor nodes, the implementation of security in WSNs is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a protocol, quality-based distance vector routing (QDV), for securing WSNs using concepts based on ant colony optimization (ACO). Two fundamental parameters: quality-of-service (QoS) and reputation are used. The high value of reputation of a node signifies that the node is trusted and is more reliable for data communication purposes. As a node shows signs of misbehavior, its reputation decreases, which, in turn, affect its quality-of-security (QSec), thereby disabling the malicious nodes from gaining access to the network. By incorporating these two factors, we are able to distinguish the nodes present in the network. We, then, present a method to achieve "equilibrium" where the node is able to guarantee that its neighbors are secure.},

After presenting the proposed method, we evaluate its performance by applying it to some low density parity check (LDPC) codes and convolutional codes.

Extensive field trials verify the viability of various front-haul solutions, including common public radio interface compression, single fiber bidirection and wavelength-division multiplexing. In addition, C-RANs facilitation of coordinated multipoint (CoMP) implementation is demonstrated with 50\%-100\% uplink CoMP gain observed in field trials. Finally, a test bed is established based on general purpose platform with assisted accelerators.

The powerful emissions of these devices can create electromagnetic interference and disrupt radio communication using the same frequency, so these devices are limited to certain bands of frequencies. In general, communications equipment operating in ISM bands must tolerate any interference generated by ISM applications, and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation in these bands. Despite the intent of the original allocations, in recent years the fastest-growing use of these bands has been for short-range, low power wireless communications systems, since these bands are often approved for such devices, which can be used without a government license, as would otherwise be required for transmitters; ISM frequencies are often chosen for this purpose as they already must tolerate interference issues. Cordless phones, Bluetooth devices, near-field communication (NFC) devices, garage door openers, baby monitors and wireless computer networks (Wi-Fi) may all use the ISM frequencies, although these low power transmitters are not considered to be ISM devices.},

Although the details are, of necessity, different from parallel programming for multicore processors or GPUs, many of the fundamental concepts are similar. For example, designers must understand memory hierarchy and bandwidth, spatial and temporal locality of reference, parallelism, and tradeoffs between computation and storage. This book is a practical guide for anyone interested in building FPGA systems. In a university environment, it is appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. At the same time, it is also useful for practicing system designers and embedded programmers. The book assumes the reader has a working knowledge of C/C++ and includes a significant amount of sample code. In addition, we assume familiarity with basic computer architecture concepts (pipelining, speedup, Amdahl's Law, etc.). A knowledge of the RTL-based FPGA design flow is helpful, although not required.},

Thus, from this perspective, the interest allocated to low-power wireless networks of sensors is higher than ever. In this paper, the SigFox scalability is analyzed from the IoT concept point of view. In the scientific research, there are a series of papers which tackle the SigFox issues, oftentimes at a comparative study level, without evaluating the performance level of the communication protocol. This paper comes to fill this gap by creating a realistic SigFox communication model. Moreover, a developed and tested generator of SigFox traffic has been implemented, using SDRs. This allows the possibility of evaluating the performance level of WSN networks, of a large-scale high-density-type. Both of the suggested instruments represent the novelty of this paper. The obtained results show that the maximum number of sensors that can transmit data at the same time, using the proposed scenarios, is of approximately 100, in order to obtain a high level of performance when the number of available channels is 360. If we are to increase the number of sensors, an avalanche effect ensues which triggers the sharp decrease of the performance of the SigFox network. At the end of this work, a series of solutions are being suggested with the main purpose of increasing the performance level of large-scale, high-density SigFox networks.},

  abstract = {Les systèmes mondiaux de navigation par satellite (GNSS) sont de plus en plus présents dansnotre vie quotidienne. Des nouveaux utilisateurs émergent avec des besoins opérationnelssupplémentaires, ce qui implique une évolution constante des systèmes de navigation actuels.Dans le cadre de Galileo (système GNSS européen) et en particulier dans Galileo E1 OpenService (OS), l’addition d’un nouveau signal d’acquisition pourrait contribuer à améliorer larésilience dans la phase d’acquisition et à réduire le temps pour géo-localiser notre récepteur(TTFF). La conception d'un nouveau signal GNSS est toujours un compromis entre plusieursfigures de mérite. Les plus pertinents sont la précision de la position, la sensibilité de récepteur etle TTFF. Cependant, si l’on considère que la phase d’acquisition du signal le principal objectif, lasensibilité et le TTFF ont une pertinence plus grande. Compte tenu de ce qui précède, dans cettethèse, il est présenté la conception conjointe d'un signal GNSS avec la structure de message afinde proposer un nouveau signal Galileo de deuxième génération, qui offre bonne sensibilité derécepteur ainsi que une réduction dans le TTFF. Plusieurs aspects ont été abordés afin deconcevoir la nouvelle composante de signal. Premièrement, la définition de la modulation doitprendre en compte la compatibilité des fréquences radioélectriques afin de provoquer un niveaude brouillage acceptable dans la bande. De plus, la modulation devrait fournir de bonnespropriétés de corrélation et une bonne résistance contre les multi trajets afin d'améliorer lasensibilité du récepteur. Deuxièmement, le choix du nouveau code PRN est également crucialpour faciliter la phase d’acquisition. Un critère de modélisation basé sur une fonction de coûtpondéré est utilisé pour évaluer la performance des codes PRN. Cette fonction de coût considèredifférent facteurs telles que l'autocorrélation, la corrélation croisée et la densité spectrale depuissance. Troisièmement, une conception conjointe entre la structure de message et le schémade codage de canal peut fournir à la fois une réduction du TTFF et une amélioration de larésilience des données décodées. Alors, une nouvelle méthode de conception de la structure demessage et du schéma de codage de canal pour le nouveau signal est proposée. Cette méthodefournit les instructions pour concevoir une structure de message dont le schéma de codage decanal est caractérisé pour les propriétés full diversity, maximum distance separable et ratecompatibility. Le codage de canal est essentiel pour améliorer les performances de démodulationde données, en particulier dans les environnements très obstrué ou avec d’interférences.Cependant, ce processus peut être très sensible au calcul correct de l'entrée du décodeur. Desaméliorations significatives ont été obtenues en considérant «soft » décodeurs, via le calcul deslog-likelihood ratio (LLR). Malheureusement, la connaissance complète des informations d'état ducanal (CSI) était généralement prise en compte, ce qui est rarement le cas dans des scénariosréels. Dans cette thèse, nous fournissons de nouvelles méthodes pour calculer desapproximations linéaires du LLR, sous les canaux de fading et interférence, en considérantcertaine information statistique sur le CSI. Finalement, transmettre un nouveau signal dans lamême fréquence porteuse et en utilisant le même amplificateur de puissance (HPA) génère descontraintes dans les méthodes de multiplexage, car une enveloppe constante ou quasi constanteest nécessaire pour réduire les distorsions non linéaires. Également, la conception dumultiplexage devrait offrir une efficacité énergétique élevée afin de ne pas gaspiller l'énergietransmis du satellite. Considérant le précédent, dans cette thèse, nous évaluons différentesméthodes de multiplexage, qui cherchent l’intégration de un nouveau signal binaire dans la bandeGalileo E1.},

This paper is specially impacting check nodes of high degrees (or high coding rates). Results of 28-nm ASIC post-synthesis for a check node of degree 12 (i.e., a code rate of 5/6 with a degree of variable equal to 2) are provided for NB-LDPC over GF(64) and GF(256). While simulations show almost no performance loss, the new proposed hybrid implementation check node increases the hardware and the power efficiency by a factor of six compared with the classical forward-backward architecture. This leads to the first ever reported implementation of a degree 12 check node over GF(256), and these preliminary results open the road to high decoding throughput, high rate, and high-order Galois field NB-LDPC decoder with a reasonable hardware complexity.},

  abstract = {In wireless communications, frame detection and synchronization are usually performed using a preamble, consuming bandwidth and resources that are not negligible for small packets. Recently, a new kind of preamble-free frame called Quasi Cyclic Small Packet (QCSP) have been proposed. This paper studies the implementation of QCSP transmission, both at the transmitter side and the receiver side. For the latter, only detection, the most consuming task, is considered. Different parallelism levels and implementation strategies are detailed for both software and hardware implementations. Several trade-offs between throughput and resource usage are also discussed. Finally, the paper demonstrates that the emission/reception process of a QCSP frame is feasible at low hardware cost, which make the QCSP frame very attractive for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN).},

  abstract = {This paper investigates delay constrained performance of a cognitive radio relay network when the cognitive (secondary) user transmission is subject to satisfying spectrum-sharing restrictions imposed by a primary user. The primary user allows a secondary user to gain access to its allocated spectrum band as long as certain thresholds on the interference power, on the peak or average values, inflicted on the primary receiver are not exceeded by the transmission of the secondary users. In addition, we assume that the secondary transmitter benefits from an intermediate node, chosen from K terminals, to relay its signal to the destination. Considering that the transmission of the secondary user is subject to satisfying a statistical delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, we study the maximum arrival rate of the secondary user's relay link while the interference limitations required by the primary user are satisfied. Particularly, we obtain the effective capacity of the secondary network and determine the power allocation policies that maximize the effective capacity of the secondary user's relaying channel. In addition, we derive closed-form expressions for the effective capacity of the channel in Rayleigh block-fading environment under peak or average interference-power constraints. Numerical simulations are provided to endorse our theoretical results.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a practical structured constellation for non-coherent communication with a single transmit antenna over Rayleigh flat and block fading channel without instantaneous channel state information. The constellation symbols belong to the Grassmannian of lines and are defined up to a complex scaling. The constellation is generated by partitioning the Grassmannian of lines into a collection of bent hypercubes and defining a mapping onto each of these bent hypercubes such that the resulting symbols are approximately uniformly distributed on the Grassmannian. With a reasonable choice of parameters, this so-called cube-split constellation has higher packing efficiency, represented by the minimum distance, than the existing structured constellations. Furthermore, exploiting the constellation structure, we propose low-complexity greedy symbol decoder and log-likelihood ratio computation, as well as an efficient way to associate it to a multilevel code with multistage decoding. Numerical results show that the performance of the cube-split constellation is close to that of a numerically optimized constellation and better than other structured constellations. It also outperforms a coherent pilot-based scheme in terms of error probability and achievable data rate in the regime of short coherence time and large constellation size.},

  abstract = {The IoT paradigm holds the promise to revolutionize the way we live and work by means of a wealth of new services, based on seamless interactions between a large amount of heterogeneous devices. After decades of conceptual inception of the IoT, in recent years a large variety of communication technologies has gradually emerged, reflecting a large diversity of application domains and of communication requirements. Such heterogeneity and fragmentation of the connectivity landscape is currently hampering the full realization of the IoT vision, by posing several complex integration challenges. In this context, the advent of 5G cellular systems, with the availability of a connectivity technology, which is at once truly ubiquitous, reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient, is considered as a potentially key driver for the yet-to emerge global IoT. In the present paper, we analyze in detail the potential of 5G technologies for the IoT, by considering both the technological and standardization aspects. We review the present-day IoT connectivity landscape, as well as the main 5G enablers for the IoT. Last but not least, we illustrate the massive business shifts that a tight link between IoT and 5G may cause in the operator and vendors ecosystem.},

Indeed, even if Error Correction Code (ECC) decoders were previously implemented on dedicated hardware targets (ASIC/FPGA), their real-time implementations on multi-core devices [3]-[5], is now possible. Software implementations currently provide high-throughput and low-latency features, scalability and also flexibility that makes them attractive for SDR systems. However, multi-core power consumption, throughput performance level and prices could be worse compared to ASIC/FPGA solutions for very high-throughput SDR systems. In this paper, a fair comparison of multi-core and FPGA solutions for the development of a 10 Gbps communication system for space communications is detailed.},

  abstract = {In 1794, French Engineer Claude Chappe coordinated the deployment of a network of dozens of optical semaphores. These formed “strings” that were hundreds of kilometers long, allowing for nationwide telegraphy. The Chappe telegraph inspired future developments of long-range telecommunications using electrical telegraphs and, later, digital telecommunication. Long-range wireless networks are used today for the Internet of Things (IoT), including industrial, agricultural, and urban applications. The long-range radio technology used today offers approximately 10 km of range. Long-range IoT solutions use “star” topology: all devices need to be within range of a gateway device. This limits the area covered by one such network to roughly a disk of a 10 km radius. In this article, we demonstrate a 103 km low-power wireless multi-hop network by combining long-range IoT radio technology with Claude Chappe’s vision. We placed 11 battery-powered devices at the former locations of the Chappe telegraph towers, hanging under helium balloons. We ran a proprietary protocol stack on these devices so they formed a 10-hop multi-hop network: devices forwarded the frames from the “previous” device in the chain. This is, to our knowledge, the longest low power multi-hop wireless network built to date, demonstrating the potential of combining long-range radio technology with multi-hop technology.},

  abstract = {The frame preamble in current WiFi systems is designed to facilitate various PHY-layer functions, including frequency offset estimation and frame detection. However, this preamble is typically fixed and is never used to convey any user-specific bits. Embedding information into the preamble opens the door for several new PHY-layer applications. For example, the PHY header no longer needs to be transmitted at a known (lowest) rate if this rate can be announced earlier in the preamble. A full-duplex transmitter can use the embedded information to inform other devices of its current operation mode (e.g., transmit/receive versus transmit/sense), obviating the need for additional control packets. In security applications, a PHY-layer sender identifier can be embedded in the preamble to facilitate PHY-level encryption. However, modifying the standard preamble to embed user information may disrupt the operation of 802.11a/n/ac devices. In this paper, we propose P-modulation, a method that enables an OFDM-based 802.11 transmitter to embed up to 19 user-specific bits in the frame preamble while maintaining the highest reliability required by the system. The proposed P-modulation is also backward-compatible with legacy receivers. Our analysis and USRP-based experimental results confirm the practicality of the scheme. Our scheme further provides insights into designing time-varying preambles for future wireless systems.},

  abstract = {Transmission of short packets in a wireless network is not efficient with classical methods. In fact, most of the available bandwidth is wasted for coordination (network layer), for synchronization (frame header) and for error correction coding (physical layer), leaving little effective throughput rate for data. In this context, the paper proposes a new frame structure called Quasi-Cyclic Short Packet (QCSP) based on the combination of a Cyclic Code Shift Keying (CCSK) modulation and a non-binary error control code. The key idea is to fully exploit the natural cyclic property of the CCSK modulation to perform the frame detection and synchronization in an ALOHA protocol to avoid useless overhead. A theoretical detection model is constructed and used to analyze the detection performance of the frame in very low SNR (from -30dB to -5 dB). As an example of application, it is shown that a payload of size 120 bits can be transmitted and received correctly with a probability of 99.99\% at a signal to noise ratio of -9.75 dB, just 1.2 dB from the Polyanskiy's bound (the estimated Shannon limit for small packet size).},

  abstract = {Digital receivers based on 1-bit quantization and oversampling w.r.t. the transmit signal bandwidth promise lower energy consumption. However, since 1-bit quantization is a highly non-linear operation, standard receiver algorithms cannot be applied. Thus, we derive performance bounds for phase, timing, and frequency estimation in order to gain a deeper insight into the impact of 1-bit quantization and oversampling. We identify uniform phase and sample dithering as crucial to combat the effect of the non-linearity introduced by 1-bit quantization. Since oversampling results in noise correlation, a closed form of the likelihood function is not available. Thus, we study a system model with white noise by adapting the receive filter bandwidth to the sampling rate. Considering the aforementioned dithering, we obtain very tight closed form lower bounds on the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the large sample regime. We show that with uniform phase and sample dithering, all large sample properties of the CRLB of the unquantized receiver are preserved under 1-bit quantization, except for an signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) dependent performance loss that can be decreased by oversampling. Numerical computations show that the properties of the CRLB for white noise still hold for colored noise except that the performance loss due to 1-bit quantization is reduced.},

Normally, these activities are best done in series but there is a desire to complete these tasks in parallel so that commercial deployments of 5G can begin by 2020. 5G will not be an incremental improvement over its predecessors; it aims to be a revolutionary leap forward in terms of data rates, latency, massive connectivity, network reliability, and energy efficiency. These capabilities are targeted at realizing high-speed connectivity, the Internet of Things, augmented virtual reality, the tactile internet, and so on. The requirements of 5G are expected to be met by new spectrum in the microwave bands (3.3-4.2 GHz), and utilizing large bandwidths available in mm-wave bands, increasing spatial degrees of freedom via large antenna arrays and 3-D MIMO, network densification, and new waveforms that provide scalability and flexibility to meet the varying demands of 5G services. Unlike the one size fits all 4G core networks, the 5G core network must be flexible and adaptable and is expected to simultaneously provide optimized support for the diverse 5G use case categories. In this paper, we provide an overview of 5G research, standardization trials, and deployment challenges. Due to the enormous scope of 5G systems, it is necessary to provide some direction in a tutorial article, and in this overview, the focus is largely user centric, rather than device centric. In addition to surveying the state of play in the area, we identify leading technologies, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, and outline the key challenges ahead, with research test beds delivering promising performance but pre-commercial trials lagging behind the desired 5G targets.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing number of resource-constrained machine-type communication (MTC) devices is leading to the critical challenge of fulfilling diverse communication requirements in dynamic and ultra-dense wireless environments. Among different application scenarios that the upcoming 5G and beyond cellular networks are expected to support, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTCs), and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLCs), the mMTC brings the unique technical challenge of supporting a huge number of MTC devices in cellular networks, which is the main focus of this paper. The related challenges include quality of service (QoS) provisioning, handling highly dynamic and sporadic MTC traffic, huge signalling overhead, and radio access network (RAN) congestion. In this regard, this paper aims to identify and analyze the involved technical issues, to review recent advances, to highlight potential solutions and to propose new research directions. First, starting with an overview of mMTC features and QoS provisioning issues, we present the key enablers for mMTC in cellular networks. Along with the highlights on the inefficiency of the legacy random access (RA) procedure in the mMTC scenario, we then present the key features and channel access mechanisms in the emerging cellular IoT standards, namely, LTE-M and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). Subsequently, we present a framework for the performance analysis of transmission scheduling with the QoS support along with the issues involved in short data packet transmission. Next, we provide a detailed overview of the existing and emerging solutions toward addressing RAN congestion problem, and then identify potential advantages, challenges, and use cases for the applications of emerging machine learning (ML) techniques in ultra-dense cellular networks. Out of several ML techniques, we focus on the application of low-complexity Q-learning approach in the mMTC scenario along with the recent advances toward enhancing its learning performance and convergence. Finally, we discuss some open research challenges and promising future research directions.},

We reformulate the mixed-domain FFT-BP decoding algorithm and develop a decoder architecture that does not exclude the multiplication units. This allows mapping a part of the algorithm to the multiplier cores embedded in an FPGA, thus making use of all the types of FPGA resources. Then, the throughput limit achievable in a single FPGA by the proposed decoder is significantly increased. We also consider another important optimization of the decoder implementation, mainly an efficient realization of the permutation units and an approximated evaluation of the nonlinear functions of messages. Another motivation is to make the decoder easily scalable for FPGA devices of different sizes. To achieve this goal, the configurable semi-parallel decoder architecture is applied operating for the structured subclass of codes.},

  abstract = {La radio logicielle est une technologie prometteuse pour répondre aux exigences de flexibilité des nouvelles générations de standards de communication. Elle peut être facilement reprogrammée au niveau logiciel pour implémenter différentes formes d'onde. En s'appuyant sur une technologie dite logicielle telle que les microprocesseurs, cette approche est particulièrement flexible et assez facile à mettre en œuvre. Cependant, ce type de technologie conduit généralement à une faible capacité de calcul et, par conséquent, à des débit faibles. Pour résoudre ce problème, la technologie FPGA s'avère être une bonne alternative pour la mise en œuvre de la radio logicielle. En effet, les FPGAs offrent une puissance de calcul élevée et peuvent être reconfigurés. Ainsi, inclure des FPGAs dans le concept de radio logicielle peut permettre de prendre en charge plus de formes d'onde avec des exigences plus strictes qu'une approche basée sur la technologie logicielle. Cependant, les principaux inconvénients d’une conception à base de FPGAs sont le niveau du langage de description d'entrée qui doit typiquement être le niveau matériel, et le temps de reconfiguration qui peut dépasser les exigences d'exécution si le FPGA est entièrement reconfiguré. Pour surmonter ces problèmes, cette thèse propose une méthodologie de conception qui exploite à la fois la synthèse de haut niveau et la reconfiguration dynamique. La méthodologie proposée donne un cadre pour construire une radio flexible pour la radio logicielle à base de FPGAs et qui peut être reconfigurée pendant l'exécution.},

  abstract = {Optimizing compilers apply numerous interdependent optimizations, leading to the notoriously difficult phase-ordering problem - that of deciding which transformations to apply and in which order. Fortunately, new infrastructures such as the polyhedral compilation framework host a variety of transformations, facilitating the efficient exploration and configuration of multiple transformation sequences. Many powerful optimizations, however, remain external to the polyhedral framework, including vectorization. The low-level, target-specific aspects of vectorization for fine-grain SIMD has so far excluded it from being part of the polyhedral framework. In this paper we examine the interactions between loop transformations of the polyhedral framework and subsequent vectorization. We model the performance impact of the different loop transformations and vectorization strategies, and then show how this cost model can be integrated seamlessly into the polyhedral representation. This predictive modelling facilitates efficient exploration and educated decision making to best apply various polyhedral loop transformations while considering the subsequent effects of different vectorization schemes. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and benefit of tuning the polyhedral model in the context of vectorization. Experimental results confirm that our model has accurate predictions, providing speedups of over 2.0times on average over traditional innermost-loop vectorization on PowerPC970 and Cell-SPU SIMD platforms.},

However, most of research on TDCS assume perfect synchronization to simplify algorithm design. In this paper, we present a low complexity symbol timing offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation method for practical TDCS applications. By utilizing preamble consisted of multiple identical training sequences, STO can be estimated by the demodulation procedure of cyclic code shift keying (CCSK), in which the circular correlation is performed by utilizing fast Fourier transform (FFT). Thus the estimation procedure is significantly simplified with considerable complexity reduction, which is analyzed and compared to other two conventional methods. The simulation results demonstrates that the proposed STO and CFO estimation scheme is a low complexity solution for TDCS in multipath Rayleigh fading channels with comparable estimation performance in terms of probability of incorrect timing offset and mean-square-error of CFO.},

  abstract = {N-body simulations are computation-intensive applications that calculate the motion of a large number of bodies under pair-wise forces. Although different versions of n-body codes have been widely used in many scientific fields, the performance and energy efficiency of various n-body codes have not been comprehensively studied, especially when they are running on newly released multi-core CPUs and GPUs (e.g., Tesla K20). In this paper, we evaluate the performance and energy efficiency of five parallel n-body implementations on two different multi-core CPU systems and on two different types of GPUs. Our experimental results show that up to 71\% of the energy can be saved by using all cores of a Xeon E5620 CPU instead of only one. We find hyper-threading to be able to further reduce the energy usage and runtime, but not by as much as adding more cores does. Finally, our experiments illustrate that GPU-based acceleration using a Tesla K20c can boost the performance and energy efficiency by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a real-time visual mapping scheme which can be implemented on a low-cost embedded system for consumer-level ratio control (RC) drones. In our work, a 3-dimensional occupancy grid map is obtained based on an estimated trajectory from data fusion of multiple on-board sensors, composed of two downward-facing cameras, two forward-facing cameras, a GPS receiver, a magnetic compass and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with 3-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes. Taking the advantages of the low-cost FPGA and ARM NEON intrinsics, we run our visual odometry and mapping algorithms at 10Hz on board. Meanwhile, we also present a hierarchical multi-sensor fusion algorithm to provide a robust trajectory for mapping usage. Finally, we verify the feasibility of our approaches and serval potential applications with experimental results in complex indoor/outdoor environments.},
